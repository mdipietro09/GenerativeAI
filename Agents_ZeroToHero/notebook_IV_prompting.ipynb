      "1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to find the product of 30 and 10.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - We need to multiply these two numbers together, which can be visualized as adding 30 ten times or adding 10 thirty times.\n",

      "   \n",
      "   - Adding 10 thirty times: \\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Counting the Total Number of Units**: \n",
      "   - For 30 added ten times, we have \\( 30 \\times 10 = 300 \\) (since each addition increases by 30 and is repeated 10 times).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding Place Values**: Each digit's value depends on its position.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - In 30, the '3' is in the tens place, so it represents 30 (or simply 3 * 10 = 30).\n",
      "   - The '0' represents no value.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multiplication with Place Values**:\n",
      "   - For 30, when multiplied by 10, each digit of 3 is effectively moved one place to the left in a positional system.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - Hence, \\( 30 \\times 10 = 300 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Verification**: \n",
      "   - Breaking it down: \\( 30 \\times 10 = (3 \\times 10) + (0 \\times 10) = 30 + 0 = 30 \\)\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - The value of each unit digit in 30 remains the same, but its position shifts to represent tens. So we get \\( 30 \\times 10 = 300 \\).\n",
